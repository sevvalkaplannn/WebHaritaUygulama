# WebMapping
During my internship, I was responsible for performing operations related to
specifying and managing the x and y coordinates of selected points or a route
on a map. This included tasks such as adding, updating, and deleting these
coordinates. On the backend, I utilized .NET 7 and C# to develop the necessary
functionalities, while on the frontend, I worked with vanilla JavaScript, HTML,
and CSS. Additionally, I integrated extra libraries such as OpenLayers, JsPanel,
and Toastify into our project to enhance its capabilities.

You can reach my .Net7 backend codes in EFCoreBa≈üarsoftInternship folder,
and you can reach my frontend codes from Web folder.
